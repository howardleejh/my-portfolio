                  My experience here allowed me to gain highly proficient
                  knowledge of various AV equipment workflows and integrations,
                  able to design and set up events with custom graphics and
                  visuals, cater to audio requirements, lighting design, signal
                  routing to multiple sources and locations and implement full
                  show control on various AV aspects with the Bitfocus Companion
                  and the Elgato Streamdeck. It also gave me experience with
                  Live streaming and cross-posting on multiple Facebook
                  platforms including cloud streaming services and various
                  hardware and software encoders. My most notable achievement at
                  Facebook was developing a documentation on the utilites and
                  workflows of the Elgato Streamdeck and Bitfocus Companion
                  which is now being utilized by various teams across Meta
                  globally. I also participated in two official openings of the
                  Meta Offices, both in Singapore and Hong Kong as part of the
                  event operations team working with key appointment holders

                  During the entirety of my course, I've developed a passion for
                  blockchain technology, DEFI, Crypto, NFTs and Javascript 3D
                  Libraries. I learnt about the basics of becoming a software
                  developer, learnt to use various tools and libraries to assist
                  with web development. My main Tech Stack would be the MERN
                  stack, comprising of MongoDB, Express JS. React JS and Node
                  JS. I also had experiences with Python and basics of
                  frameworks such as Django and Flask. I developed a total of 4
                  projects:

                  At Centaur Finance, I learnt so much about the Blockchain
                  Technologies, understanding Decentralized Finance and learning
                  how to write Smart Contracts with Solidity. I was taught to
                  study multiple EIP standards and to utilize Open Zeppelin for
                  all of my smart contract creations. I worked with 3 main tools
                  while developing for the blockchain, mainly Hardhat, Ethers JS
                  and Remix IDE. I am now able to create smart contracts for
                  different deployments, using the ERC standards to develop
                  tokens for NFT projects, creating automated Escrow Contracts
                  and creating simple gamification utilities such as lotteries.
                  I am also able to connect to providers such as Metamask,
                  Infura and Alchemy when interacting with my deployed smart
                  contracts, creating Interfaces with React JS to complete the
                  entire experience of a DAPP. I utilize IPFS for decentralized
                  storage and pinning services such as Pinata to retrieve
                  required data, most evidently used when developing NFT
                  projects. For more information, please refer to my LinkedIn

                  A Blockchain Developer at Igloo Insure currently based in
                  Singapore. My most notable project with Igloo Insure was to
                  develop and deploy a set of solutions on the blockchain based
                  off multiple smart contracts, that has various interactions
                  with the multiple insurance policies. We utilized both
                  off-chain and on-chain data to facilitate monetary exchanges
                  between the various stakeholders. We also used tokenomics,
                  algorithms and oracles to retrieve data and automate this
                  process while providing transparency and decentralization to
                  boost our users' confidence as we continue to strive to become
                  the most simple, painless and honest insurance for all. The
                  project is still in development phase but we've successfully
                  completed and presented to our potential clients on our
                  proof-of-concept.
